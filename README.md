# S-P_500_Screener

This is taking the S&P500 tickers from wikipedia and pulling the yahoo finance data for them from the prior seven days. From there I am calculating the total return over those seven days and filtering for buys and sells. The threshold for buys is 5% or greater and the threshold for sells is -8% or less.
